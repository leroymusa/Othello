1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player have some advantage, at least for a random strategy? 

	Based on the results of multiple simulations, Player 2 (P2) 
	appears to have a slight advantage over Player 1 (P1) when 
	both players use a random strategy. The win probabilities 
	for P2 consistently show a higher percentage across several 
	trials, suggesting that even with randomness, some 
	advantage exists for P2.


2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA



3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below:

	The video shows how coding-based simulations make statistical concepts more intuitive. 
	It highlights methods like shuffling and bootstrapping to test hypotheses, 
	offering an alternative to classical statistics. The focus is on using simulations 
	to better understand data distributions and assess significance, 
	making it simpler for those who think in code.


4) H0 is 
	Player 1 and Player 2 have equal chances of winning. 
	In other words, there is no significant difference in the win probabilities between P1 and P2.



5) Ha is 
	Player 1 and Player 2 do not have equal chances of winning. 
	This implies that one player has a higher win probability than the other.



6) Choose one of the following and delete the other:
   	My experimental results do not support H0, so they support Ha



7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0

	Java Class: OthelloSimulation.java
	
	By running multiple simulations with random strategies for both players and calculating 
	the win probabilities, the observed differences were evaluated using shuffling and 
	randomization techniques. A p-value was derived from the simulation results, 
	showing that the differences in win probabilities between P1 and P2 are 
	statistically significant. Therefore, the null hypothesis (H0) is rejected.
